# widgets

Many widgets has the same effect as a css property in web technoledge.

To make an element has some opacity, in css, we just add a property: `opacity: 0.3`,
and in flutter, we use a widget `Opacity`,
and if we want the opacity to animate, we use `AnimatedOpacity`.

The widgets are shorthand ??
